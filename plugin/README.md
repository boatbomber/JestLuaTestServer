# JestLuaTestServer Plugin

Roblox Studio plugin that executes Jest Lua tests on behalf of the JestLuaTestServer.

## Overview

This plugin runs inside Roblox Studio and acts as the test execution engine for the JestLuaTestServer system. It receives test files via Server-Sent Events (SSE), deserializes them, executes the tests using Jest Lua, and reports results back to the server.

## Architecture

The plugin consists of two main components:

1. **Main.server.lua**: Entry point that handles plugin initialization
2. **TestsManager.lua**: Core test execution manager that handles SSE communication, test deserialization, and result reporting

## How It Works

### 1. Initialization
When the plugin starts, it:
- Waits for the server to be healthy by polling `/health`
- Establishes an SSE connection to `/_events` endpoint
- Begins listening for test execution requests

### 2. Test Reception
Tests are received in chunks via SSE:
- `test_start`: Initializes buffer for incoming test data
- `test_chunk`: Receives binary chunks of the `.rbxm` file
- `test_end`: Triggers test deserialization and execution

### 3. Test Execution
When a complete test is received:
- Deserializes the `.rbxm` file using `SerializationService`
- Injects a default `jest.config` if not present
- Runs the tests using Jest Lua with configured options
- Captures test results or errors

### 4. Result Reporting
After test execution:
- Sends results back to server via POST to `/_results`
- Includes test ID and outcome (success/failure with details)

## Configuration

The plugin reads its configuration from `serverSettings.json`, which is automatically generated by the server during plugin installation. Settings include:

- `host`: Server hostname (default: `127.0.0.1`)
- `port`: Server port (default: `8325`)
- `test_timeout`: Maximum test execution time in milliseconds

## Jest Configuration

Default Jest options used by the plugin:

```lua
{
    verbose = false,
    ci = true,
    testTimeout = <from serverSettings>,
    testMatch = {
        "**/*.(spec|test)",
    },
    testPathIgnorePatterns = {
        "Packages",
        "DevPackages",
    }
}
```

## Installation

The plugin is automatically installed by the server when it starts:

1. Server reads plugin source from this directory
2. Injects current server settings into `serverSettings.json`
3. Builds the plugin using Rojo
4. Installs to Roblox Studio's plugin directory

## Manual Usage (Workaround)

Due to a current Roblox Studio limitation with `CreateWebStreamClient` in plugins, the plugin must be started manually:

1. The plugin automatically copies itself to `game.ServerStorage`
2. Open the Studio command bar
3. Run: `require(game.ServerStorage.TestsManager):start()`

## Building

To build the plugin manually:

```bash
cd plugin
rojo build -o plugin.rbxm
```

## API

### TestsManager Module

#### Methods

##### `TestsManager:start()`
Initializes the plugin and establishes server connection.

##### `TestsManager:runTest(testId: string)`
Executes a test and returns results.

Returns:
- `{ success: true, results: JestResults }` on success
- `{ success: false, error: string }` on failure

##### `TestsManager:deserializeTest(testId: string)`
Deserializes a buffered `.rbxm` file into Roblox instances.

##### `TestsManager:reportTestOutcome(testId: string, outcome: table)`
Sends test results back to the server.

##### `TestsManager:handleSSEMessage(message: string)`
Processes incoming SSE messages from the server.

## Error Handling

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling:

- Network failures are logged but don't crash the plugin
- Test timeouts are enforced and reported
- Deserialization errors are caught and reported
- Jest execution errors are captured and sent to server

## Debugging

Enable verbose logging by modifying the Jest options:

```lua
local runCLIOptions = {
    verbose = true,  -- Change to true for detailed output
    -- ... other options
}
```

Check the Studio output window for plugin logs and error messages.

## Known Issues

1. **CreateWebStreamClient Bug**: The API is currently broken for Studio plugins, requiring manual startup from the command bar
2. **Test Isolation**: Tests run in the same environment, so global state changes may affect subsequent tests

## Dependencies

The plugin requires these to be present in the test place:

- Jest Lua and all its dependencies (installed via Wally)
- Roblox Studio with SSE support enabled (via FFlags)
